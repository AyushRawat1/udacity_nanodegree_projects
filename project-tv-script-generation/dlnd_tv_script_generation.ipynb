    "\n",
    "6) n_layers: Chose 2 because we need loss below 3.5 and it makes loss decrease faster if i used an activation function loss for me was starting at 9.80 when i removed the activation funstion it started well and also in the course i learnt that choosing between 2 and 3 is a good practice 2 works for me well\n",
